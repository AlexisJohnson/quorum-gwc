## Code for the Girls Who Code Hackathon

Welcome to the Girls Who Code Congressional Hackathon! We've put together three different types of projects that you can work on. All three of these projects depend on the QuorumAPI class that we built together earlier today, and we're excited to let you start using it.

##Projects

1. *Trends*: Generate a trend graph of the number of bills introduced, that left committee, that passed the House/Senate, etc. per chamber over the last few years.
2. *Choropleth*: Generate a map with each state colored by the number of times a given word or phrase has been mentioned in Congress.
3. *Wordcloud*: Generate a wordcloud of the words used by Members of Congress when they talk about a given topic.

##Directory Structure
Each project has its own folder, appropriately named "trends", "choropleth", and "wordcloud". You can switch into those projects by running `cd <projectname>`, and once there, further instructions will await you in the README associated with each project. In this folder are the following files:

- *api.py*: This file contains our global API class. Go spend some time reading through this file -- you'll be using it in all
- *enums.py*: This file contains a set of enums, or helpful classes that we use to organize data in Quorum.
